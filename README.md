# AugustDB

A key/value store backed by [LSM Trees](http://www.benstopford.com/2015/02/14/log-structured-merge-trees/) and SSTables.

This project is a work in progress ðŸš§ and is being developed primarily to suit the author's personal study goals ðŸŽ“. But if you find something in here that helps you learn, that's great too!

## Initial design

All writes are first written to a commit log, protecting against crashes.

Newly written values are stored in a memtable backed by [:gb_trees](https://erlang.org/doc/man/gb_trees.html).

[We define a binary SSTable format](#sstable-format).

We use phoenix to expose a REST API (PUT, GET, DEL) for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (for now) string resources using `Content-Type: application/json`. [Support for application/octet-stream](https://github.com/Terkwood/AugustDB/issues/24) is forthcoming.

## Webservice operation

To start the Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Making HTTP calls

Create a record

```sh
curl -X PUT  -d value='meh meh'  http://localhost:4000/api/values/1
```

Update a record

```sh
curl -X PUT  -d value='n0 n0'  http://localhost:4000/api/values/1
```

Get a record

```sh
curl  http://localhost:4000/api/values/1
```

Delete a record

```sh
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4000/api/values/1
```

## SSTable Format

A Sorted String Table contains zero or more _gzipped key/value chunks_.

### GZipped key/value chunks

A _sized gzip chunk_ follows this binary specification:

1. First four bytes: length of the gzipped chunk
2. <variable length bytes>: gzipped chunk of key/value pairs, with tombstones.

### Unzipped key/value chunks

Each unzipped chunk contains zero or more key/value records.
Each record describes its own length. Some keys may point to
tombstones.

#### Value records

1. Length of key in bytes
2. Length of value in bytes
3. Raw key, not escaped
4. Raw value, not escaped

#### Tombstone records

1. Length of key in bytes
2. `2^32 - 1` to indicate tombstone
3. Raw key, not escaped

### Example in hex

One can image a simple, uncompressed binary representation of keys to values:

- hey: now
- no: yes
- one: _TOMBSTONE_
- three: four

In practice you won't ever see this sequence on disk, because the records
will be gzipped.

## Inspiration

[Kleppmann: Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) gives a fantastic summary of local-node operation for data stores using SSTable, followed by detail on strategies for replication and partitioning. Check it out!

I sourced https://github.com/tamas-soos/expoll/blob/master/lib/ex_poll_web/views/poll_view.ex as a preliminary example for working with Phoenix.

## Dev environment

You should enable [multi-time warp mode](https://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html#Multi_Time_Warp_Mode) during development in the REPL.

```sh
ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS="+C multi_time_warp" iex -S mix
```

## Generating docs

You can [follow the CLI instructions for ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc#using-exdoc-via-command-line):

```sh
ex_doc "AugustDB" "0.0.0" "_build/dev/lib/august_db/ebin"
 -m "AugustDbWeb.ValueController" -u "https://github.com/Terkwood/AugustDB"
```

## ðŸ”® The Glorious Future: a distributed system

~~First implement a local key-value store that uses a memtable, SSTables, and a commit log~~. Then implement a replicating data store which syncs via gossip. Then implement partitioning using vnodes. [See the issue tracker](https://github.com/Terkwood/AugustDB/issues/15).
