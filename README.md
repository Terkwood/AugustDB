# AugustDB

A key/value store backed by [LSM Trees](http://www.benstopford.com/2015/02/14/log-structured-merge-trees/) and SSTables.

This project is a work in progress ðŸš§ and is being developed primarily to suit the author's personal study goals ðŸŽ“.  But if you find something in here that helps you learn, that's great too!

## Initial design

Use gb_trees as memtable.

Use nimble_csv to generate SSTable format.

Use phoenix to expose a REST API (PUT, GET, DEL).

## Notional distributed system

First implement a local key-value store that uses a memtable, SSTables, and a commit log.  Then implement a replicating data store which syncs via gossip.  Then implement partitioning using vnodes.

### Inspiration

[Kleppmann: Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) gives a fantastic summary of local-node operation for data stores using SSTable, followed by detail on strategies for replication and partitioning.  Check it out!

I sourced https://github.com/tamas-soos/expoll/blob/master/lib/ex_poll_web/views/poll_view.ex as a preliminary example for working with Phoenix.

## Dev environment

You should enable [multi-time warp mode](https://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/time_correction.html#Multi_Time_Warp_Mode) during development in the REPL.

```sh
ELIXIR_ERL_OPTIONS="+C multi_time_warp" iex -S mix
```

## REST API examples

We haven't written any docs yet. But you can see some examples using curl [in value_controller.ex](https://github.com/Terkwood/AugustDB/blob/main/lib/august_db_web/controllers/value_controller.ex).

## Generating docs

You can [follow the CLI instructions for ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc#using-exdoc-via-command-line):

```sh
ex_doc "AugustDB" "0.0.0" "_build/dev/lib/august_db/ebin"
 -m "AugustDbWeb.ValueController" -u "https://github.com/Terkwood/AugustDB"
```

## Webservice operation

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
